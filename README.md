## Excel Support

### üìä New in v1.1.0: Excel File Support

Database Import Pro now supports importing from Excel files (.xlsx and .xls) in addition to CSV files!

#### Intelligent Format Detection
The plugin automatically detects your server's capabilities and only shows supported file formats:

‚úÖ **CSV files** - Always supported, no special requirements  
‚úÖ **Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)** - Requires PHPSpreadsheet library (see below)

#### System Status Page
Navigate to **Database Import Pro > System Status** to:
- Check which file formats are supported on your server
- View PHP extension requirements
- See detailed instructions for enabling Excel support
- Debug system configuration

#### Enabling Excel Support

**Option 1: Using Composer (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /path/to/wp-content/plugins/database-import-pro
composer install --no-dev
```

**Option 2: Manual Installation**
1. Download PHPSpreadsheet from [GitHub](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet)
2. Extract to `vendor/` directory in the plugin folder
3. Ensure autoloading is properly configured

**Required PHP Extensions:**
- ZIP extension (for .xlsx files)
- XML extension
- XMLReader extension
- GD extension (optional, for images)

**Important:** The plugin gracefully handles missing dependencies. If Excel support is not available, only CSV files will be accepted, and users will see clear messaging about the limitation.

#### User Experience
